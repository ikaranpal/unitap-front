							ONBOARDING USERS TO WEB3 HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CHALLENGE
						</p>
						<p className="about-section__text">
							When a user wants to begin using a network, they may find it hard to obtain gas tokens to get started.
							Faucets are abused because there has never been an appropriate sybil resistance tool.
						</p>
						<p className="about-section__text">
							With BrightID, we can solve this problem. BrightID is a social identity network that allows users to prove
							that they are only using one account.

								Gas Tap is a place where users can receive small amounts of gas tokens from numerous networks in order

								Token Tap can facilitate the distribution of any kind of token, including; UBI tokens, NFTs, Community
								Tokens, Airdrops, etc. It uses BrightID to keep the bots out. Uses:
								<br />
								1. Help users interact with DAOs, apps, and services by distributing small amounts of the tokens used in
								those ecosystems.
								<br />
								2. Help projects in the test phase distribute their token to users. They can also set some bug bounties
								to incentivize users.
								<br />
								3. Distribute several UBI tokens in one place.
								<br />
								4. Prioritize real users over airdrop hunters by limiting the number of tokens one person can claim.

							</div>
							<p className="about-section__text">
								Beginning users cannot effectively onboard to web3 via the current learn-to-earn platforms because they
								don’t teach users how to take the very first steps. We believe that almost all of the current
								learn-to-earn platforms’ users are already onboarded to web3 and largely complete tasks to be eligible
								for airdrops.
							</p>

							<p className="about-section__text">
								Learn Tap can utilize Gas tap and Token Tap to help onboard new users to Web3 all in one place with
								absolutely no cost to the user.
							</p>

							<p className="about-section__text">
								Users learn how to set up a wallet first, then how to add a network, and then they can claim their first
								gas tokens from the Gas Tap. After that, users can claim tokens from Token Tap to learn how to work with
								Web3 projects like swapping, providing liquidity, staking, voting, etc. In many cases, a brand new human
								user can go from zero to being an on-chain crypto user all in one place with no cost to the user.

								platforms, in Launch Tap, every unique human will benefit from each launch through Prize Tap.

								Unitap offers the ability for users to access raffles for valuable items. Instead of each user receiving

								larger prize. A main source of prizes will be Launch Tap: 1% of each launch will be distributed to
								verified unique humans via Prize Tap. This will provide buzz around the launch and give Unitap users a
								reason to keep coming back.
